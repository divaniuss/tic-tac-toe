# Network Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This code implements a network-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players using a client-server architecture.

## General Workflow

### Server (Server):
Waits for two clients to connect.
Assigns "X" to one player and "O" to the other.
Receives moves from clients and updates the game board (Field).
Checks for win conditions, a tie, or an occupied cell.
Sends the move result to the other player.

### Clients (Client and Client2):
Connect to the server.
Receive their assigned symbols ("X" or "O").
Enter move coordinates and send them to the server.
Receive the updated game board or a game-over message.

### Game Board (Field):
Stores the current game state.
Checks if a move results in a win.
Displays the current game board.

Thus, clients interact with the server, which manages the game logic.
